  <p>A popular destination is Central Park in Manhattan. It has ice skating during the winter, a petting zoo, restaurants, concerts and other activities during the year. If you want information on what event is going on in Central Park click <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/"target="_blank">here</a>. You can also get information for other parks around the city at the parks and recreation website <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/parks-list?boro=M"target="_blank"> here</a>.

    <h2>Venues</h2>

     <p>
     Everybody loves a Broadway theatre show. I find that the best tickets for weekdays or afternoon shows are the best priced. There are several ways to get tickets you can go to the theater box office or use sites like<a href="http://in.ticketmaster.com/broadway/"target="_blank"> Ticketmaster</a> or <a href="https://www.broadway.com/shows/tickets/"target="_blank">broadway.com.</a> At times some shows give away free tickets through a lottery process. Also, you can go for the “Off Broadway” shows that are less expensive and are previews to many shows before they become the next sensation on Broadway.

      For concerts or sports venues the most popular are<a href="https://www.msg.com/radio-city-music-hall?cmp=van_radiocity"target="_blank">Radio City Music Hall</a> located on 50th and 6 Avenue, <a href="https://www.msg.com/madison-square-garden"target="_blank">Madison Square Garden</a> between 31st and 32nd street between 7th and 8th avenue and the <a href="http://www.lct.org/"target="_blank">Lincoln Center</a> located on 150 West 65th Street and Broadway Avenue.

    <h2>Museums</h2>
 <div class="center"> 

    <p>
       Museums are a great way to spend the day. There are different museums for kids, adults or the whole family. I find that this <a href="https://www.ny.com/museums/all.museums.html"target="_blank">website</a> gives you a complete listing of the museum’s in NYC and links to the museums official websites. The website states that <q>during the second Tuesday of June all museums in the mile stretch from 105th and 5th Avenue to 82nd Street are free to the public for that evening.</q>

      <p>
      When it comes to food you can find just about anything in NYC and for every budget. You have not experienced NYC unless you had a pizza slice. You can get a slice of pizza from $1 to the gourmet type which can be $6 and up per slice.<br>So, if your preference is fast food to gourmet it will be easy to find. I have a preference for “mom and pop” diners for real burgers and milk shakes. For the health conscious there are a variety of health food stores or restaurants that cater to vegans.

    <h2>New York Public Library (NYPL)</h2>
     <div class="center"> 

     <p>
      One of the best places to visit and get information is the library. <a href="https://www.nypl.org/"target="_blank">The New York City Public Library </a> has a long rich history. Not only does it provides free information for its members but has computer workshops, classes and other informational seminars. Please visit your local public library.
