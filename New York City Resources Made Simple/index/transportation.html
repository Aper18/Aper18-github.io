 The best way to get around the city is using public transportation. Parking is expensive especially in Manhattan. The outer borough’s (The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island) car use is more manageable but depending on the neighborhood parking can also be an issue. <br>The <a href="http://www.mta.info" target="_blank">MTA</a> has all the information for train and bus routes. They even have a trip planner section where you can input the address to get to your destination. If you want to get away from the city it also, provides information for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), Metro North, Port Authority Tolls and Bridges. It’s always a good idea to check their website or download a MTA app to keep up with the latest changes. There are several options for free download of their apps in the website for iOS’s or Android.</p>

 If you still want to drive into Manhattan you can look up rates for the different public parking garages, choose to park at a <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/meterpark.shtml"target="_blank">meter</a> or if lucky find a side street to park. NYC.gov provides information on <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1029/alternate-side-parking-or-street-cleaning"target="_blank">alternate side parking and street cleaning</a>. As always plan ahead, especially during the weekend.
